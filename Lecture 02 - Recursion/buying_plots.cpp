Buying two empty plots
We have a sequence of plots as before, but we want to build two buildings requiring K acres each, so we want to buy two such subsections so that the number of plots in the two subsections is minimized.

Note that the two subsections we require must be disjoint, so it is not enough to pick the two best subsections overall.
