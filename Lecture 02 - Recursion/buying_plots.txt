Buying empty plots
-------------------

Along one side of a road there is a sequence of vacant plots of land. Each plot has a different area (non-zero). So, the areas form a sequence A[1], A[2], â€¦ A[N].

You want to buy K acres of land to build a house. You want to find a segment of continguous plots (i.e., a subsection in the sequence) of minimum length whose sum is exactly K.


Buying two empty plots
----------------------
We have a sequence of plots as before, but we want to build two buildings requiring K acres each, so we want to buy two such subsections so that the number of plots in the two subsections is minimized.

Note that the two subsections we require must be disjoint, so it is not enough to pick the two best subsections overall.
